# Input-Counter

This code counts words, alphabets, special characters and numbers from text (.txt) files. 

We can count the above using two methods
1. By entering just the file name - for this, you need to keep the code file (input counter.py) and the text file you want to use in the same folder.
2. By entering path of the file - for this you just need to enter the path of the file which can exist anywhere on your computer.
