# Input-Counter

This code counts words, alphabets, special characters and numbers from text (.txt) files. 

We can count the above using two methods
1. By entering just the file name - you need to keep the code file (input counter.py) and the text file you want to use in the same folder for this method to work.
2. By entering path of the file - you just need to enter the path of the file which can exist anywhere on your computer.
